# SAS-Base-Advanced
Base &amp; Advanced SAS Multifunctional codes. Practice + Projects
There are 3 sub-folders inside. I've splitted them accordingly to my learnings from various sources/teachers.
You can run them on SAS Academy edition also. First upload the .sas file then go through the code and then upload the required file used in the code.
